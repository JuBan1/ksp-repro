 
 1) Run `fun main` inside the `app-desktop`. Everything should work.
 2) Open `gradle/libs.versions.toml`, replace the two variables `ksp` and `kotlin` with the two uncommented ones.
 3) Rerun the application. Should fail now be the file at `org.koin.ksp.generated.module` (which is generated by ksp) is now missing.

 Going back to 1.8.21 fixes the issue again.
